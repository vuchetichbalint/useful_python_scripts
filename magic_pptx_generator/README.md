# Macig PPTX generator

This is a magical script generating a simlpe pptx from words for a lecturer in a horrible haste. ;)

Add search terms to the terms.csv file, it will get images from google, and than generates a pptx slides with the title+image.

Furthermore you can set the title what appear in the slides in the second column.
